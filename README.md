## Build Instructions

Connect the Quest headset to your computer via a USB cable. In the headset make sure to allow the device to access data. If the option doesn’t show up, go to quick settings on the left, then to settings on top right of quick settings, and scroll down to Developer and turn on USB Connection Dialog. Now in the Unity editor make sure the main scene is open. A mostly unlit office should be viewable if you are in the correct scene. If not, in the project view to the right of the game view navigate to Assets->Scenes and double click ScareCoOffices. Now navigate to build settings via File -> Build Settings. Click on the android section in the list on the left. Make sure to switch platform to android by clicking the button on the bottom right of the Build Settings window. Now the Quest device you connected should show up under the Run Device list. Now click Build and Run. When the build is finished you can unplug the headset and put it on. In the Quest you navigate to Apps, click on the drop down at the top, and find the Unknown Sources section. From here you can run the application.
